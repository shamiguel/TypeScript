# Today: 

## TypeScript
Had an up and down morning trying to reorient my learning with TypeScript. 

In the LinkedIn Learning video:

I was able to get through Ch. 4. HOWEVER, I was not able to complete the solution for this chapter's challenge. I did give myself ten minutes before looking at the solution but even then it did not make sense. I thought I would try to review chapters 3-4 again and trying to tackle it before I realized I should take a step back and try to do a simpler coding project. First I tried to convert previous projects to TypeScript but kept running into issues with having Sequelize utilize Types. SO, I decided to switch gears and try a small project tutorial from scratch. 

I was able to fully complete this video's project:
